\subsection{linear diophantine equation}
In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is an equation, typically a polynomial equation in two or more unknowns with integer coefficients, such that the only solutions of 
interest are the integer ones. A linear Diophantine equation equates to a constant the sum of two or more monomials, each of degree one.

\begin{equation}
   ax + by = c
\end{equation}
where a, b and c are given integers. The solutions are described by the following theorem:

This Diophantine equation has a solution (where x and y are integers) if and only if c is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of a and b. Moreover, if (x, y) is a 
solution, then the other solutions have the form (x + kv, y âˆ’ ku), where k is an arbitrary integer, and u and v are the quotients of a and b (respectively) by the 
greatest common divisor of a and b.
